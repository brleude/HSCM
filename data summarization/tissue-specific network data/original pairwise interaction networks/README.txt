original pairwise interaction networks.
The 11 tissue-specific networks are constructed by leveraging the research of tissue-specific atlas of abundance data from 7,811 proteomic samples across 11 human tissues[1]. Specifically, we focused on an interaction network of synaptic proteins. The network encompassed 109,913 brain coabundance associations and 121,732 synaptosome cofractionated interactions, culminating in a validated network of 37,318 protein interactions among synaptic proteins. Each potential interaction in the corresponding tissue is assigned an association score (ranging from 0 to 1) to quantify the functional association strength between proteins in a specific tissue context. We filtered out interactions with an association score of at least 0.8 in each tissue to construct 11 tissue-specific networks.
